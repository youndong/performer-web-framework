<p>Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google and is
based upon a modified version of the Linux kernel. It was initially
developed by Android Inc. (a firm purchased by Google) and later
positioned in the Open Handset Alliance. According to NPD Group, unit
sales for Android OS smartphones ranked first among all smartphone OS
handsets sold in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2010, at 33%.
BlackBerry OS is second at 28%, and iOS is ranked third with 22%.</p>

<p>Android has a large community of developers writing application
programs (apps) that extend the functionality of the devices. There are
currently over 70,000 apps available for Android with some estimates
saying 100,000 have been submitted, which makes it the second most
popular mobile development environment. Developers write managed code in
the Java language, controlling the device via Google-developed Java
libraries.</p>
<p>The unveiling of the Android distribution on 5 November 2007 was
announced with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium
of 78 hardware, software, and telecom companies devoted to advancing
open standards for mobile devices. Google released most of the
Android code under the Apache License, a free software and open source
license.</p>
<p>The Android operating system software stack consists of Java
applications running on a Java based object oriented application
framework on top of Java core libraries running on a Dalvik virtual
machine featuring JIT compilation. Libraries written in C include the
surface manager, OpenCore[14] media framework, SQLite relational
database management system, OpenGL ES 2.0 3D graphics API, WebKit layout
engine, SGL graphics engine, SSL, and Bionic libc. The Android operating
system consists of 12 million lines of code including 3 million lines of
XML, 2.8 million lines of C, 2.1 million lines of Java, and 1.75 million
lines of C++.</p>
